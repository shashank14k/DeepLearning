The aim of this project is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image segmentation. Once trained, the CNN will be able to perform image segmentaion 
on MRI scans.
# Image Segmentation
Image segmentation entails differentiating different components in an image. For our purpose, for instance, we need to differentiate between tumor and other parts of
the brain. Hence, the model will be able to identify tumor and non-tumor regions in MRI scans.
