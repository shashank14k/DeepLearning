Using transfer learning to train a Densenet network to predict the presence of various diseases in chest-xrays. Since the dataset was extremely larget and training the network 
required excessive computational power, the notebook was implemented in Kaggle environment. There's scope to improve the model which are discussed at the end of the notebook.
