The aim of the project is to build a CNN that can diagnose presence of thorax diseases from chest X-rays.
# DATA
The data used for training can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shashank069/chest-xray-classification/data). It inlcudes chest Xrays from 30,805 patients. There are multiple X-rays for some patients which were probably taken at different points of time. These patients might have succumbed to new diseases and hence separate xrays of the same patient might have presence of different diseases.
